    "A dictionary is implemented using a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be hashable.A hash is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs. This system works fine if the keys are immutable. But if the keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key, or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly. That’s why keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The simplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next experiment.\n",
